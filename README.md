# Bootcamp-Module-1-Challenge

This repository is for the Module 1 Challenge and it contains the HTML and CSS files along with the images used for the challenge. In addition to the files that were uploaded, each one also has a brief description of the changes that were made to it with each commit. From the starter code I used, I made a few changes to the HTML code and one change to the CSS code. These changes made the code more semantically correct and followed a logical structure of HTML elements.
